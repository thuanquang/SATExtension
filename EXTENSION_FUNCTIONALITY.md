# SAT Quiz Blocker Extension Functionality

This document outlines the core functionality of the SAT Quiz Blocker extension, focusing on the quiz presentation, interaction, and data handling logic. It serves as a reference to prevent regressions and ensure consistent behavior.

## 1. Core Purpose

The primary goal of this extension is to block user-specified distracting websites and require them to correctly answer an SAT question to regain access.

## 2. Quiz Triggering and Data Handling

- **Quiz Triggering**: The quiz is shown if the `quizInterval` (defined in `config.js`) has passed since the last successfully completed quiz. This is checked by the `shouldShowQuiz` function in `content.js`.
- **Fetching Questions**: Questions are fetched from a Supabase database using the `getRandomQuestion` method in `supabase-client.js`.
- **Data Validation**:
    - The `formatQuestion` method ensures that every question is well-formed before being used. It returns `null` if a question is invalid (e.g., missing text, insufficient answer choices).
    - The `getRandomQuestion` method includes a retry mechanism. If `formatQuestion` returns `null`, it will attempt to fetch another question up to 5 times to prevent showing a broken quiz.

## 3. Quiz Interaction Flow

The quiz interaction is managed within `content.js` and is designed to be robust and user-friendly.

### Initial State (Quiz Active)

- **Blocking**: When the quiz is active, the `blockWebsite` function creates a full-screen overlay (`sat-quiz-overlay`) and the quiz modal.
- **Interaction Lock**: The `preventDefault` method blocks **all** user interactions outside of the quiz modal. This includes:
    - Clicking the overlay.
    - Scrolling the main page.
    - Any other clicks or key presses.
- The user **cannot** close the modal by clicking outside or scrolling.

### Answering the Question

- **Submission**: The `handleSubmit` function manages the answer submission. The "Submit" button is temporarily disabled to prevent multiple submissions.
- **Incorrect Answer**:
    - The `handleIncorrectAnswer` function is called.
    - The attempts counter is incremented.
    - If the user has remaining attempts, an error message is shown, and the "Submit" button is re-enabled.
- **Max Attempts Reached**:
    - If the user runs out of attempts, the `handleMaxAttempts` function is called.
    - This triggers **Review Mode**.

### Correct Answer

- If the user answers correctly, the `handleCorrectAnswer` function is called.
- This immediately triggers **Review Mode**.

## 4. Review Mode (`isReviewing`)

Review Mode is activated when a quiz is completed, either by answering correctly or by running out of attempts. The `isReviewing` property is set to `true`. This mode has different rules:

- **Scrolling is ENABLED**: The user can freely scroll the modal to read the explanation, no matter how long it is.
- **Click Outside to Close is ENABLED**: The user can click on the dark overlay (`sat-quiz-overlay`) to prematurely close the quiz and unblock the website.
- **Cooldown Timer**:
    - A cooldown timer starts (`startCooldownTimer`).
    - The duration is configurable via `explanationReviewTime` (for correct answers) or `cooldownPeriod` (for max attempts) in `config.js`.
    - The timer's text explicitly states that the user can click outside to close early.
    - If the user does not close it manually, the website is unblocked automatically when the timer finishes.

## 5. Error Handling and Recovery

### Recent Fixes (Latest Update)

**Issue**: Quiz automatically and prematurely exiting after 3 seconds when forcing new quiz or during other scenarios.

**Root Cause**: Aggressive 3-second timeouts in the `showQuiz()` method that automatically unblocked the website on any error condition.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Extended Timeout Duration**: 
   - Changed from 3 seconds to 15 seconds (configurable via `errorTimeout` in `config.js`)
   - Gives more time for network recovery and user understanding

2. **Retry Mechanism**:
   - Added 3-attempt retry logic for question fetching
   - 2-second delays between retries for normal failures
   - 3-second delays for network errors
   - Progressive feedback showing retry attempts

3. **Enhanced Loading States**:
   - Added loading feedback during question fetching
   - Clear visual indicators for different states (loading, error, success)
   - Better user communication about what's happening

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - More descriptive error messages
   - Graceful handling of network issues
   - Better feedback for different error types

5. **Race Condition Prevention**:
   - Added small delay in `forceQuiz()` to ensure proper overlay creation
   - Better initialization checks
   - Improved error recovery in force quiz scenarios

### Error Timeout Configuration

- **`errorTimeout`**: New configurable setting in `config.js` (default: 15 seconds)
- Controls how long to wait before auto-unblocking on errors
- Can be adjusted based on network conditions and user preferences

### Loading and Feedback System

- **Loading State**: Shows "Loading quiz..." with attempt counter during retries
- **Error State**: Shows specific error messages with recovery suggestions
- **Success State**: Clears feedback when quiz loads successfully
- **Overlay Feedback**: Shows messages on overlay when modal isn't created yet

## 6. Current Issue and Debugging

### Problem Description
The extension shows the grey overlay (background gets greyed up) but then disappears after a few seconds without showing the quiz modal. This suggests an error in the quiz loading process.

### Debugging Approach
1. **Enhanced Error Logging**: Added comprehensive error handling and logging to `showQuiz()` method to identify where the failure occurs.
2. **Error Display**: Modified `showFeedback()` to display errors on the overlay when the modal hasn't been created yet.
3. **Initialization Checks**: Added checks for SupabaseClient availability and proper initialization.
4. **Debug Page**: Created `debug-extension.html` to test each component step by step.

### Debug Steps
1. Open `debug-extension.html` in a browser with the extension enabled
2. Run each test section to identify the failing component:
   - Extension Status Check
   - Configuration Test
   - Supabase Connection Test

.option-label:has(input[type="radio"]:checked) {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #007BFF 0%, #0056b3 100%);
  color: white;
  font-weight: 600;
  text-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

/* Fallback for older browsers */
.option-label.selected {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #007BFF 0%, #0056b3 100%);
  color: white;
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

**JavaScript Enhancement:**
```javascript
// Add 'selected' class to the parent label of checked radio
const parentLabel = input.closest('.option-label');
if (parentLabel) {
  parentLabel.classList.add('selected');
}
```

#### 2. Intelligent Display Management
- **CSS Improvements**: Changed from `display: none` to proper visibility management
- **Dynamic Styling**: Applies appropriate classes and styles based on message type
- **Smooth Animations**: Added fade-in effects and transitions for better UX

#### 3. Overlay Fallback System
- **Backup Display**: When modal doesn't exist, shows messages on the overlay
- **Enhanced Styling**: Professional-looking overlay messages with proper theming
- **Auto-cleanup**: Automatically removes old messages before showing new ones

#### 4. Enhanced Error Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even if some components fail
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive console logging for debugging
- **Failsafe Mechanisms**: Multiple fallback strategies ensure messages are always shown

### Technical Implementation

**New CSS Features:**
```css
/* Always visible, styling changes based on content */
#feedback {
  display: block;
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

#feedback:empty {
  display: none; /* Only hide when truly empty */
}

/* Enhanced animations for each state */
#feedback.success { animation: fadeInSuccess 0.3s ease-in-out; }
#feedback.error { animation: fadeInError 0.3s ease-in-out; }
#feedback.loading { animation: fadeInLoading 0.3s ease-in-out; }
```
