# SAT Quiz Blocker - Functionality Improvements & Fixes

## 🚀 Overview

This document outlines all the functionality improvements, bug fixes, and best practice implementations made to the SAT Quiz Blocker extension to ensure it works correctly and follows modern web development standards.

## 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. **Modal Display Architecture Fix**
**Problem:** QuizModal and BlockManager were both creating their own overlays, causing conflicts and preventing the modal from appearing.

**Solution:**
- Modified `QuizModal.create()` to accept an existing overlay from `BlockManager`
- Updated `QuizController._createAndShowModal()` to pass BlockManager's overlay to QuizModal
- Fixed show/hide methods to work with the proper overlay element
- Ensured proper z-index (2147483647) for always-on-top display

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/QuizModal.js`
- `src/controller/QuizController.js`
- `src/styles/styles.css`

### 2. **Focus Management & Modal Visibility**
**Problem:** Modal show/hide methods were targeting wrong elements and display properties.

**Solution:**
- Fixed `show()` method to display overlay with `flex` instead of `block`
- Added proper overlay visibility management
- Implemented focus trapping and restoration for accessibility
- Added escape key handling in review mode

## 🎯 Accessibility Improvements

### 1. **ARIA Labels & Semantic Markup**
- Added proper `role`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby` attributes
- Implemented `fieldset` and `legend` for multiple choice options
