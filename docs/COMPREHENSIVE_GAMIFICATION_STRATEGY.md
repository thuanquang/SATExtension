# SAT Quiz Extension - Comprehensive Gamification Strategy

## üéØ Extension Overview

### Current Core Functionality
The SAT Quiz Extension operates as a **productivity-learning hybrid** that blocks websites every 30 minutes, requiring users to correctly answer SAT questions to continue browsing. The system features:

- **Website Blocking System**: Full-screen overlay with blur effect that prevents interaction until quiz completion
- **Quiz Prompts**: Time-based triggers every 30 minutes with manual override capability
- **Question Variety**: Multiple choice and numeric questions across Algebra, Geometry, Grammar, Vocabulary, and Science
- **Difficulty Progression**: Three-tier system (Easy, Medium, Hard) with intelligent question selection
- **Progress Tracking**: Basic statistics including questions answered, total attempts, and timing data
- **Immediate Feedback**: Instant response validation with detailed explanations and 10-second review periods
- **Modular Architecture**: Component-based design ready for feature expansion

### Current Engagement Mechanisms
The extension currently employs **limited gamification elements**:

- **Negative Reinforcement**: Website blocking creates urgency and motivation to complete quizzes
- **Immediate Feedback**: Success/failure notifications with educational explanations
- **Basic Statistics**: Simple tracking of questions answered and total attempts
- **Persistent Progress**: Data retention across browser sessions

### Target Demographics & Psychology
- **Primary Users**: High school students (ages 16-18) preparing for SAT tests
- **Core Challenge**: Digital distraction management during study periods
- **Motivation Drivers**: Achievement, mastery, social comparison, personal growth
- **Learning Preferences**: Visual feedback, immediate gratification, clear progress indicators

### Technical Constraints & Opportunities
- **Chrome Extension Framework**: Manifest V3 with storage, scripting, and activeTab permissions
- **Database**: Supabase backend with robust question management system
- **Architecture**: Modular JavaScript components enabling easy feature additions
- **Performance**: Efficient DOM manipulation and memory management

    showEncouragementMessage("Ready for a bigger challenge!");
}
else if (accuracy <= 60% over last 10 questions) {
    decreaseDifficulty();
    provideSupportMessage("Let's build confidence with some practice!");
}

Subject-Specific Adjustments:
trackAccuracyBySubject() {
    mathAccuracy = getRecentAccuracy("Algebra", "Geometry");
    verbalAccuracy = getRecentAccuracy("Grammar", "Vocabulary");
    
    if (mathAccuracy > verbalAccuracy + 20%) {
        increaseMathDifficulty();
        maintainVerbalDifficulty();
    }
}

Streak-Based Modifications:
if (correctStreak >= 5) {
    introduceChallengeQuestions();
    applyStreakBonusRewards();
}
else if (incorrectStreak >= 3) {
    provideFoundationalQuestions();
    activateSupportMode();
}
```

**Weakness Detection & Targeting:**
```
Analysis Patterns:
